 <p id="info">Cole is the Black Ninja and current Elemental Master of Earth and the son of Lou and Lilly. He was recruited by Wu, and with the old man's help, Cole learned Spinjitzu and discovered his other teammates, with whom he embarked on many adventures; battling the likes of the Serpentine and the Stone Army.
    After the final battle, peace resumed until the Overlord returned and created the Nindroid Army. The Overlord made the Nindroid army by using Zane's blueprints. During this time, a love triangle formed between Nya, Jay, and Cole. The conflict ended when Zane sacrificed himself to vanquish the Overlord. Saddened by Zane's death, the ninja parted ways but reunited after learning of Zane's survival and set out to rescue Zane on a mysterious island. There, Jay and Cole made amends over Nya, while the ninja allied with the Elemental Masters to defeat Chen's Anacondrai Cultists, who had caused the Second Serpentine War.
    
    Shortly after, the ninja battled Morro and spirits from the Cursed Realm. Needing to learn Airjitzu, the ninja went to the Temple of Airjitzu, where Cole was turned into a ghost. He soon came to terms with his condition and used his new abilities. Following the ghost invasion, the ninja were tormented by Nadakhan, who captured Cole in the Djinn Blade. After Cole and the others were freed, Jay used his last wish to undo recent events. On the Day of the Departed, Cole confronted Yang, who tricked Cole into reviving the ninja's old enemies. Cole fought Yang, but eventually made amends with him, and Cole became a human once more via the Rift of Return.</p>
